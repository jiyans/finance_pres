* Theory
** Expected Return Fair Game
All "expected return theories" can be described as follows.
\( E(\tilde p_{j,t+1} | \Phi_{t} ) = [1 + E(\tilde r_{j,t+1}|\Phi_{t})]p_{jt}  \)
 - \( p_{jt} \) is the price of security \(j\) at time \(t\)
 - \( r_{jt} \) is the return of \(j\) from \(t-1\) to \(t\)
 - \( \Phi_t \) is information set at t
 - ~  indicates random variable
*** Implication
From the definition of the model we have.
\( z_{j,t+1} = r_{j, t+1} - E(\tilde{r}_{j, t+1} | \Phi_t) \)

\( E(\tilde{z}_{j,t+1} | \Phi_t) = 0 \)

Now let
 - \( \alpha(\Phi_{t}) = [\alpha_1(\Phi_t), \alpha_2(\Phi_t), ..., \alpha_{n}(\Phi_{t})] \)
 - \( V_{t+1} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha_j(\Phi_t)[r_{j, t+1} - E(\tilde{r}_{t, j+1} | \Phi_t ) ] \)
Then is a testable implication from the expected return efficient markets model.
 - \( E(\tilde{V}_{t+1} | \Phi_{t} ) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha_j(\Phi_t) E(\tilde{z}_{t, j+1} | \Phi_t ) = 0 \)
** Submartingale model
Makes use of the expected return model as well,
but we assume that:

 - \( \forall t, \Phi_t ( E(\tilde{r}_{j, t+ 1} | \Phi_t ) \ge 0 \ ) \)

 - The testable assumption here is that expected returns conditional on \( \Phi_t \) cannot have greater expected profits than a policy of always buying-and-holding.
** Random Walk
\( f(r_{j, t+1} | \Phi_{t}) = f(r_{j, t+1}) \)
where \( f \) is a Probability density function. ( and the same probability density function ).
( Past information tells us nothing about the next step )
* Empirical Results
 - \( E(\tilde p_{j,t+1} | \Phi_{t} ) = [1 + E(\tilde r_{j,t+1}|\Phi_{t})]p_{jt}  \)
 - Weak form: \( \Phi_t \) is past data
 - Semi-strong form: \( \Phi_t \) is news
 - Strong form: \( \Phi_t \) is investing skill or other monopolistic access to information relevant
* Weak Form Test Evidence

Random Walk theory can basically be interpreted as a special case of the Fair Game Theory, thus tests of the Random Walk theory are tests of the Fair Game Theory by extension
** Test of Market Efficiency in the Random Walk Literature

:END:
 - In Random Walk theory, tests of the Efficient Markets models were often conducted
 - They were conducted by using the serial covariances of returns
 - Even though this kind of test is stricter than needed for the "Fair Game" theory it seems to hold up

However, Random walk theory fails on some parts
 - Large changes are followed by large changes
   However, sign is seemingly random
 - Reversals are more likely than continuations
 - Continuations are more likely after continuations than after reversals

These phenomena do point to the existence of market inefficiencies, but not of the semi-strong form, but of the strong form
** More tests
 - Fair game models in the treasury bill market
 - Multiple security expected return model
* Semi-strong Form Test Evidence
These tests are usually done with a certain type of event.
In this paper the main type of event introduced were stock splits.
** Splits and the Adjustment of Stock Prices to New Information
 - Splits themselves are not new sources of information
 - Splits are assumed to be proxies for other important information
 - If stock splits are associated with abnormal behavior, this would be reflected in
   the estimated regression residuals in the months surrounding the splits
 - Average and cumulative average residuals in months before splits are calculated
 - Stocks were usually split in extraordinarily good times

*** Considering Dividend increases and decreases
 - When the dividend increases after a split, we can see that there are slight increases in stock price
 - When the dividend decreases after a split, the stock prices decreases a lot, and falls to around the level of 5 months before the split
 - This might be the level of when we first hear about the stock dividends

*** Considering the splits as a whole
 - We can see that when considering all splits as a whole
   the stock price stays the same and thus we can say that the market captures all publicly available information
** Other studies of public announcements
 - Annual earnings announcements
 - Announcements of discount rate changes
 - Large secondary offerings of stock on newly issued stock
* Strong Form Tests Evidence
** Theoretical framework
   - In the strong form tests we want to study whether individuals with "monopolistic" access to information are able to obtain higher than expected profits
   - To do that we look at whether
     a) whether in general fund managers are able to generate "abnormal" returns
     b) whether some funds are better att uncovering special information than others.
   - The major problem with this kind of test is the creation of the base model

** Empirical Results
 - Fama cites Jensen, who measured risk-return performance of 115 mutual funds from 1955-1964
 - As far as net returns to investors are concerned, funds seem to not outperform the market
 - Just holding the market portfolio would have left most investors better off
* Conclusion
 - Efficient Market models seem to not be refutes by the tests
 - It was very interesting that many problems that many problems were pointed out here already
